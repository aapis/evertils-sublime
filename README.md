# evertils-sublime

[`evertils`](https://github.com/aapis/evertils) extension for Sublime Text 2 (+ 3, but I haven't tested that).

## Important

This won't work without the evertils package!  The plan is for this to eventually install the evertils package as part of the installation process but currently you have to ensure it is already installed.
